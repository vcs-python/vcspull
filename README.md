# $ vcspull &middot; [![Python Package](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/vcspull.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/vcspull/) [![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/vcs-python/vcspull.svg)](https://github.com/vcs-python/vcspull/blob/master/LICENSE) [![Code Coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/vcs-python/vcspull/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/vcs-python/vcspull)

Synchronize repos in bulk from JSON or YAML file. Compare to
[myrepos](http://myrepos.branchable.com/). Built on [libvcs](https://github.com/vcs-python/libvcs)

Great if you use the same repos at the same locations across multiple
machines or want to clone / update a pattern of repos without having to
`cd` into each one.

- clone /update to the latest repos with `$ vcspull`
- use filters to specify a location, repo url or pattern in the
  manifest to clone / update
- supports svn, git, hg version control systems
- automatically checkout fresh repositories
- supports [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/)-style URL's
  ([RFC3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986)-based [url
  scheme](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/topics/vcs-support/))

See the [documentation](https://vcspull.git-pull.com/), [configuration](https://vcspull.git-pull.com/configuration/) examples, and [config generators](https://vcspull.git-pull.com/configuration/generation.html).

# how to

## install

```console
$ pip install --user vcspull
```

### Developmental releases

You can test the unpublished version of vcspull before its released.

- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):

  ```console
  $ pip install --user --upgrade --pre vcspull
  ```

- [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/docs/):

  ```console
  $ pipx install --suffix=@next 'vcspull' --pip-args '\--pre' --force
  ```

  Then use `vcspull@next sync [config]...`.

## configure

add repos you want vcspull to manage to `~/.vcspull.yaml`.

_vcspull does not currently scan for repos on your system, but it may in
the future_

```yaml
~/code/:
  flask: "git+https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask.git"
~/study/c:
  awesome: "git+git://git.naquadah.org/awesome.git"
~/study/data-structures-algorithms/c:
  libds: "git+https://github.com/zhemao/libds.git"
  algoxy:
    repo: "git+https://github.com/liuxinyu95/AlgoXY.git"
    remotes:
      tony: "git+ssh://git@github.com/tony/AlgoXY.git"
```

(see the author's
[.vcspull.yaml](https://github.com/tony/.dot-config/blob/master/.vcspull.yaml),
more [configuration](https://vcspull.git-pull.com/configuration.html))

next, on other machines, copy your `$HOME/.vcspull.yaml` file or
`$HOME/.vcspull/` directory them and you can clone your repos
consistently. vcspull automatically handles building nested directories.
Updating already cloned/checked out repos is done automatically if they
already exist.

## clone / update your repos

```console
$ vcspull
```

keep nested VCS repositories updated too, lets say you have a mercurial
or svn project with a git dependency:

`external_deps.yaml` in your project root, (can be anything):

```yaml
./vendor/:
  sdl2pp: "git+https://github.com/libSDL2pp/libSDL2pp.git"
```

clone / update repos:

```console
$ vcspull sync -c external_deps.yaml
```

See the [Quickstart](https://vcspull.git-pull.com/quickstart.html) for
more.

## pulling specific repos

have a lot of repos?

you can choose to update only select repos through
[fnmatch](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/fnmatch.html)
patterns. remember to add the repos to your `~/.vcspull.{json,yaml}`
first.

The patterns can be filtered by by directory, repo name or vcs url.

```console
// any repo starting with "fla"
$ vcspull sync "fla*"
// any repo with django in the name
$ vcspull sync "*django*"

// search by vcs + url
// since urls are in this format <vcs>+<protocol>://<url>
$ vcspull sync "git+*"

// any git repo with python in the vcspull
$ vcspull sync "git+*python*

// any git repo with django in the vcs url
$ vcspull sync "git+*django*"

// all repositories in your ~/code directory
$ vcspull sync "$HOME/code/*"
```
