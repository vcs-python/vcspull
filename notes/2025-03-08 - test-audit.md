    - Test dry-run functionality
    - Test progress reporting for long operations

## Conclusion

VCSPull has a solid test foundation covering most core functionality, but has significant gaps in validation, error handling, specific VCS operations, and advanced features. While the 85% overall coverage is good, numerical coverage alone doesn't ensure that all important scenarios are tested.

The CLI interface and configuration management are thoroughly tested, but coverage is lacking in areas like repository state handling, network resilience, cross-platform behavior, and performance under stress. Adding tests for these scenarios would significantly improve the robustness of VCSPull in real-world usage where edge cases frequently occur.

Strategic improvements in the identified areas would not only increase code coverage metrics but, more importantly, would enhance the reliability and maintainability of the software, particularly in challenging environments with complex repository states, network issues, or resource constraints.
