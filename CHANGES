<!-- END PLACEHOLDER - ADD NEW CHANGELOG ENTRIES BELOW THIS LINE -->

### Breaking changes

#### cli(sync): Route dry-run JSON through OutputFormatter (#514)

JSON dry-run output bypassed `OutputFormatter`, producing a nested
workspace schema instead of the flat array used by other commands.
Dry-run JSON and NDJSON now use the same `formatter.emit()` path.

- Dry-run `--json` output is now a flat array of plan entries, matching
  the schema of `sync --json` and `status --json`

### What's new

#### cli(_formatter): Add `_HelpTheme` protocol for argparse colorization (#514)

Add a typed protocol documenting the CPython 3.14+ argparse theme
attributes consumed by `VcspullHelpFormatter`. The formatter hooks into
`_theme` to colorize example command blocks in help text, applying
distinct colors to program names, subcommands, and options.

### Bug fixes

#### cli(status): Fix false "up to date" and phantom dirty counts (#514)

`check_repo_status` initialized `ahead`/`behind` to `0` instead of
`None` when no upstream is tracked, causing `_determine_plan_action`
to report repos as "up to date" when the remote state was actually
unknown. Additionally, non-git directories (where `clean` is `None`)
were counted as dirty in the status summary.

- Initialize `ahead`/`behind` as `None` so missing upstream propagates
  correctly
- Use identity checks (`is True` / `is False`) instead of truthiness
  for `clean`, excluding non-git repos from clean/dirty counts

#### cli(sync): Deduplicate repos matched by multiple patterns (#514)

When multiple patterns matched the same repository (e.g. `"myrepo"`
and `"*"`), the repo was synced multiple times. Repos are now
deduplicated by path after pattern matching.

#### cli(sync): Report non-git repos as UPDATE in dry-run plan (#514)

`_determine_plan_action` blocked non-git repos in dry-run output even
though `update_repo` supports SVN and Mercurial via `create_project()`.
Non-git repos now show `UPDATE` with a "non-git VCS" detail instead of
`BLOCKED`.

#### cli(sync): Widen `update_repo` return type (#514)

Return type was annotated as `GitSync` but `create_project()` returns
`GitSync | HgSync | SvnSync`. The annotation now matches the actual
return type.

#### cli(_formatter): Complete option classification for help colorization (#514)

The help formatter's option sets were missing several flags (`-d`,
`-x`, `-V`, `--fetch`, `--offline`, `--verbose`, etc.) and
value-expecting options (`--max-concurrent`, `--name`, `--url`),
causing tokens following those options to be misclassified in colorized
help output.

### Documentation

- Update sync examples in README and quickstart to use `--all`, matching
  the v1.53.0 CLI change (#514)

### Tests

- Add SVN and Mercurial tests for `update_repo` to verify non-git VCS
  paths (#514)

## vcspull v1.53.0 (2026-02-08)

### What's new

#### cli: Show help when commands are called without arguments (#511)

Running `vcspull sync`, `vcspull search`, `vcspull add`, or
`vcspull discover` with no arguments now prints the command's help
screen instead of raising a cryptic argparse error or silently doing
nothing. This makes the CLI self-documenting — new users can explore
available options without reaching for `--help`, and experienced users
get an instant reminder of the expected syntax.

### Breaking changes

#### cli(sync): Require `--all` to sync all repositories (#511)

`vcspull sync` without arguments previously synced nothing and exited
silently. It now shows help instead. To sync every configured
repository, use the new `--all` (or `-a`) flag:

```console
$ vcspull sync --all
```

- Passing `--all` with positional patterns is an error (mutually exclusive)
- The `"*"` glob pattern still works as an alternative to `--all`

## vcspull v1.52.1 (2026-02-08)

### Tests

#### conftest: Fix test failures in clean build environments (#513)

Tests now pass in environments without a global git identity (e.g. Arch
Linux nspawn containers with Python 3.14). The autouse `setup` fixture
sets `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME`, `GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL`, `GIT_COMMITTER_NAME`, and
`GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL` as environment variables so subprocesses inherit
git identity regardless of `~/.gitconfig` resolution.

- Add `@skip_if_hg_missing` / `@skip_if_svn_missing` markers directly on
  test functions where libvcs fixture-level markers don't propagate
  reliably under `asyncio_mode = "auto"`
- Add pytester-based harness tests that validate fixture infrastructure
  in isolated subprocess environments

## vcspull v1.52.0 (2026-02-07)

### Breaking changes

- Bump minimum libvcs from v0.38.6 -> v0.39.0 (#512)

  Adds `SyncResult` and various other bug fixes to syncing.

### Features

#### cli(sync): Detect and report errored git syncs (#512)

`vcspull sync` now detects git fetch/pull failures via libvcs's `SyncResult`
and reports them as errors instead of silently succeeding. The sync summary
shows errored repositories alongside successful and failed counts.

- Only pass `set_remotes=True` for git repositories (not SVN/HG)
- Include repository identity in sync error messages

#### cli(sync): Exit non-zero on unmatched patterns with `--exit-on-error` (#512)

When `--exit-on-error` is set and sync patterns match no configured
repositories, `vcspull sync` now exits with a non-zero status code.
Unmatched patterns are tracked separately from sync failures, giving
automation scripts a clear signal about config/pattern problems.

#### cli(sync): Improved sync summary output (#512)

- Track and display unmatched patterns separately from repo totals
- Omit "0 previewed" from non-dry-run summaries
- Suppress unmatched-pattern lines in `--summary-only` mode
- Color the total count in summary output

### Bug fixes

- Fix path-based sync patterns showing `"None"` instead of the actual search
  term (#512)

- Downgrade duplicate user-facing unmatched-pattern log message to debug level,
  so each pattern is reported only once (#512)

- Emit sync summary even when all patterns are unmatched (#512)

### Tests

- Add errored sync tests: fetch failure, exit-on-error, mixed good/errored,
  summary lines, all-fail, and cross-VCS scenarios (#512)
- Add SVN and HG errored sync tests using libvcs factory fixtures (#512)
- Add rev/branch mismatch and ambiguous branch/directory name regression
  tests (#512)
- Add unmatched pattern count, duplicate log, and path-pattern "None" message
  tests (#512)
- Refactor `test_cli.py` to use `write_config` helper and assert exit codes
  consistently (#512)

## vcspull v1.51.1 (2026-02-01)

### Tests

- Add syrupy 4.x backwards compatibility for `YamlSnapshotExtension` (#509)

  The custom snapshot extension now sets both `_file_extension` (syrupy 4.x API)
  and `file_extension` (syrupy 5.x API) to support both versions. This fixes
  test failures on systems packaging syrupy 4.6.1, such as Arch Linux (#503).

## vcspull v1.51.0 (2026-01-27)

### Breaking changes

- Bump minimum libvcs from v0.38.3 -> v0.38.6 (#506)

### Documentation

#### CLI reference pages now have linkable arguments (#502)

Each command-line argument (`--help`, `-v`, `--config`, etc.) in the CLI
reference documentation now has a permalink anchor (¶). You can hover over any
argument to reveal the link, then share direct URLs to specific options.

- Improved metadata display: Default values, types, and "Required" tags are now
  styled more clearly
- Help text containing glob patterns like `django-*` no longer triggers
  documentation build warnings
- Multiple CLI commands can now appear on the same documentation page without
  ID conflicts

### Bug fixes

#### Improve downstream compatibility in test matrix (#504)

- Refactor syrupy snapshot tests to avoid `name=` parameter which may cause
  matching issues in certain build environments, e.g., Arch Linux packaging (#503).

## vcspull v1.50.1 (2026-01-25)

### Breaking changes

- Bump minimum libvcs from v0.38.2 -> v0.38.3 (#505)

## vcspull v1.50.0 (2026-01-24)

### Breaking changes

- Bump minimum libvcs from v0.38.1 -> v0.38.2 (#501)

### Packaging / CI

- Migrate to PyPI Trusted Publisher (#492)

### Documentation

#### Replace sphinx-argparse with internal extension (#499)

sphinx-argparse broke with Sphinx 9.x due to internal API changes. This release
replaces it with `sphinx_argparse_neo`, a local extension with better architecture.

**Changes:**

- Remove `sphinx-argparse` dependency
- Uncap `sphinx` version (now `>=8` instead of `<9`)
- Add custom Pygments lexers for CLI output highlighting
- Add syntax highlighting to argparse directive HTML output

**Directive options:**

- `:no-defaults:`, `:no-description:`, `:no-epilog:`, `:no-choices:`, `:no-types:`
- sphinx-argparse compatibility: `nosubcommands`, `nodefault`, `nodescription`, `noepilog`
- `:path:` for subparser navigation
- `:mock-modules:` for mocking imports during introspection

### Development

- Add `types-docutils` and `types-Pygments` for type checking
- Clarify CLAUDE.md import style guidelines (stdlib vs third-party)

## vcspull v1.49.0 (2026-01-03)

### New features

#### New command: `vcspull search` (#494)

Search across all configured repositories using ripgrep-inspired syntax with field-scoped queries, regex patterns, and flexible output formats.

**Basic usage:**

Search for a term across all fields:

```console
$ vcspull search django
```

Search by repository name:

```console
$ vcspull search "name:flask"
```

Search by URL:

```console
$ vcspull search "url:github.com"
```

**Key features:**

- **Field-scoped queries**: Target specific fields with `name:`, `url:`, `path:`, or `vcs:` prefixes
- **Regex patterns**: Full regex support with `-i/--ignore-case`, `-S/--smart-case`, `-F/--fixed-strings`, and `--word-regexp`
- **Boolean logic**: AND (default), OR (`--any`), and inverted matching (`-v/--invert-match`)
- **Context display**: Show matching fields with `--field` filtering
- **Output formats**: Human-readable (default), `--json`, or `--ndjson` for automation
- **Color control**: `--color {auto,always,never}` with `NO_COLOR` support

**Advanced examples:**

Case-insensitive search across all fields:

```console
$ vcspull search -i DJANGO
```

Find repos by VCS type:

```console
$ vcspull search "vcs:git"
```

Match any term (OR logic):

```console
$ vcspull search --any flask django requests
```

Invert match (exclude repos):

```console
$ vcspull search -v "url:gitlab"
```

JSON output for scripting:

```console
$ vcspull search --json "name:lib"
```

### Development

#### Makefile -> Justfile (#493)

- Migrate from `Makefile` to `justfile` for running development tasks
- Update documentation to reference `just` commands

### Documentation

- Migrate docs deployment to AWS OIDC authentication and AWS CLI

## vcspull v1.48.1 (2025-12-06)

### Breaking changes

- Bump minimum libvcs from v0.38.0 -> v0.38.1 (#491)

### Documentation

#### Fix Sphinx autodoc indentation errors (#490)

- Configure `sphinx-autodoc-typehints` to prevent RST parsing conflicts with
  Napoleon-processed docstrings by disabling type injection into docstring
  bodies (`always_document_param_types`, `typehints_document_rtype`).
- Suppress cosmetic forward reference warnings from TYPE_CHECKING imports.

_Upcoming changes will be written here._

## vcspull v1.48.0 (2025-11-30)

### Breaking changes

- Bump minimum libvcs from v0.37.0 -> v0.38.0 (#489)

### Bug fixes

#### Path privacy improvements (#488)

Path privacy added to:

- `vcspull fmt`: summary banners, success logs, and `--all` listings cache the
  `PrivatePath` display value so config paths always render as `~/.vcspull.yaml`.
- `vcspull add`: invalid-config errors reuse the redacted path, keeping failure
  logs consistent with other config operations.
- `vcspull discover`: warnings for repos without remotes and "no repos found"
  notices collapse their target directories via `PrivatePath`.
- `vcspull sync`: human "Synced …" lines now mirror the structured JSON payloads
  by showing tilde-collapsed repository paths.

## vcspull v1.47.0 (2025-11-15)

### Bug Fixes

#### `vcspull discover`: Success logs redact config paths (#487)

Writes triggered by `vcspull discover` now pass the config file through
`PrivatePath`, so confirmations like "✓ Successfully updated ~/.vcspull.yaml"
and dry-run notices no longer leak the absolute home directory.

#### `vcspull discover`: Fix another workspace dir case (#487)

Discover now inspects the config scope (user/system/project) before writing,
so user-level configs like `~/.vcspull.yaml` prefer tilde-prefixed workspace
keys while project-level configs keep their relative `./` sections. Tests
cover both behaviors to guard against regressions.

### Development

#### PrivatePath centralizes home-directory redaction (#485)

- Introduced a dedicated `PrivatePath` helper for all CLI logging and structured
  output, ensuring tilde-collapsed paths stay consistent without duplicating the
  contraction logic across commands.

## vcspull v1.46.1 (2025-11-03)

### Bug Fixes

#### Fix `vcspull.__version__`

- v1.46.0 shipped with v1.45.0

#### `vcspull add`: Fix legacy `./` heuristics for path-first flow (#484)

- Path-based imports now always record their workspaces using the tilde label
  unless callers explicitly pass `--workspace ./`, avoiding stray top-level
  `./` sections.
- Duplicate-aware writes operate directly on the ordered loader output, keeping
  repeated workspace roots intact while removing the old `config_items`
  scaffolding.
- CLI decisions no longer round-trip through `normalize_workspace_roots`
  unless duplicate merges are needed, reducing the chances of accidental YAML
  rewrites during `--no-merge` operations.

## vcspull v1.46.0 (2025-11-02)

### Bug Fixes

#### `vcspull add` keeps tilde workspace labels in path-first mode (#482, #483)

- Running `vcspull add ~/study/python/…` from inside the workspace now logs the
  workspace as `~/study/python/` instead of `./`, preserving tilde-shortened
  labels for path-first imports.

## vcspull v1.45.0 (2025-11-02)

### Bug Fixes

#### `vcspull add --no-merge` preserves duplicate workspace roots (#482)

- Duplicate workspace sections are no longer flattened when adding a repository
  with `--no-merge`; all previously configured repositories stay intact.
- The configuration loader now exposes ordered duplicate entries so CLI writes
  can target the correct section without data loss.

## vcspull v1.44.0 (2025-11-02)

### Improvements

#### `vcspull add` streamlines path-first imports (#481)

- The CLI now requires a repository path as its positional argument, inferring
  the name and `origin` remote automatically. Supply `--url` to record an
  alternative remote and `--name` when you need a different label.
- Workspace roots default to the checkout's parent directory; use
  `--workspace/--workspace-root` to override the destination while keeping the
  path-first flow intact.
- CLI output contracts configuration paths to `~/.vcspull.yaml`, keeping
  dry-run previews concise when configs live under the home directory.

### Development

#### Snapshot stability for CLI logs (#481)

- Discover command snapshots replace volatile line numbers with placeholders so
  future refactors and lint rewrites do not break the test suite.

## vcspull v1.43.0 (2025-11-02)

### Improvements

#### `vcspull fmt` gains duplicate root merging (#479)

- Running `vcspull fmt` now consolidates repeated workspace sections into one
  merged block so no repositories vanish during cleanup; pass `--no-merge` if
  you want the command to surface duplicates without rewriting them.

#### `vcspull add` protects workspace configs during imports (#480)

- Default behavior now merges duplicate workspace roots so prior entries stay
  intact; add `--no-merge` to keep the raw sections and handle them yourself.
- You can invoke `vcspull add ~/study/python/project`; the command inspects the
  path, auto-fills the `origin` remote, shows the tilde-shortened workspace, and
  asks for confirmation unless you supply `--yes`.
- CLI previews now contract `$HOME` to `~/…`, matching the rest of the UX.

#### `vcspull discover` honors --no-merge (#480)

- Running `vcspull discover --no-merge` only reports duplicates—it leaves the
  file untouched until you decide to act.

#### Configuration loader: Support for duplicate workspace roots (#480)

- Commands backed by `load_configs` (`list`, `status`, `sync`, etc.)
  automatically keep every repository even when workspace sections repeat; pass
  `merge_duplicates=False` to fall back to the legacy "last entry wins"
  behavior with a warning.

### Development

#### Snapshot coverage for formatter tests (#479)

- Formatter scenarios are checked against [Syrupy] JSON/YAML snapshots, making it
  obvious when future changes alter the merged output or log text.

#### CLI `add` path-mode regression tests (#480)

- Parameterized pytest scenarios cover interactive prompts, duplicate merging,
  and path inference to keep the redesigned workflow stable.

## vcspull v1.42.0 (2025-11-01)

### Breaking changes

- Bump minimum libvcs from v0.36.0 -> v0.37.0
- Drop support for Python 3.9; the new minimum is Python 3.10 (#478)

  See also:
  - [Python 3.9 EOL timeline](https://devguide.python.org/versions/#:~:text=Release%20manager-,3.9,-PEP%20596)
  - [PEP 596](https://peps.python.org/pep-0596/)

## vcspull v1.41.0 (2025-10-25)

### Breaking Changes

#### JSON/NDJSON paths now use tilde notation

**All commands** (`list`, `status`, `sync`) now contract home directory paths in JSON/NDJSON output for consistency, privacy, and portability.

**Before:**
```json
{
  "name": "flask",
  "path": "/home/username/code/flask",
  "workspace_root": "~/code/"
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "name": "flask",
  "path": "~/code/flask",
  "workspace_root": "~/code/"
}
```

**Why:** The `workspace_root` field already used tilde notation in JSON output, creating an inconsistency. Full home paths (`/home/username/`) expose usernames and make output less portable between machines.

**Impact:** Automation consuming JSON/NDJSON output will need to expand `~` to absolute paths if required. Most tools handle tilde expansion automatically.

### Bug Fixes

- Defer imports of `ConfigDict` to `TYPE_CHECKING` blocks so CLI modules never import `typing_extensions` at runtime (#476).

  vcspull treats `typing-extensions` as a dev-only dependency, so avoiding those imports fixes crashes when the package isn’t installed in production environments and still keeps type information intact for static analysis.

## vcspull v1.40.0 (2025-10-19)

### Performance Improvements

#### Concurrent status checking (#474)

- **`vcspull status`**: Now checks repositories concurrently using asyncio
  - Dramatically faster when checking many repositories (5-10x speedup for 20+ repos)
  - Live progress display on TTY: `Progress: 5/10 ✓:3 ✗:2`
  - New `--max-concurrent N` flag to control concurrency limit (default: 32)
  - New `--no-concurrent`/`--sequential` flag to disable concurrent mode
  - Duration tracking included in JSON/NDJSON output (`duration_ms` field)
  - Uses same asyncio pattern as `vcspull sync --dry-run`
  - Backward compatible with sequential fallback option

## vcspull v1.39.1 (2025-10-19)

### Improvements

#### Improved home directories paths (#473)

- **Human-readable output**: Contract `$HOME` to `~/` in introspection commands
  - `vcspull list`, `vcspull status`, and `vcspull sync --dry-run` now display
    paths like `~/code/flask` instead of `/home/username/code/flask`
  - Reduces verbosity and avoids exposing usernames in terminal output
  - JSON/NDJSON output preserves full absolute paths for accuracy in automation
- **Documentation**: Updated all examples to use `~/` for consistency

## vcspull v1.39.0 (2025-10-19)

### Breaking Changes

This release modernizes the vcspull CLI to align with DevOps tool conventions (Terraform, Cargo, Ruff, Biome). **This is a breaking change release**.

#### Command Changes (#472)

- **REMOVED**: `vcspull import` command
  - Replaced by `vcspull add <name> <url>` to add a single repository
  - Replaced by `vcspull discover <path>` to scan and add multiple repositories
- **NEW**: `vcspull list` - List configured repositories with optional `--tree`, `--json`, `--ndjson` output
- **NEW**: `vcspull status` - Check repository health (clean/dirty status, ahead/behind tracking with `--detailed`)

#### Flag Changes (#472)

- **RENAMED**: `-c/--config` → `-f/--file` (all commands)
- **NEW**: `-w/--workspace/--workspace-root` - All three aliases supported for workspace root
- **NEW**: `--dry-run/-n` - Preview changes without making modifications (sync, add, discover)
- **NEW**: `--json/--ndjson` - Machine-readable output for automation (sync, list, status)
- **NEW**: `--color {auto,always,never}` - Control color output

#### Migration Guide (#472)

```bash
# Old → New
vcspull import NAME URL              → vcspull add NAME URL
vcspull import --scan DIR            → vcspull discover DIR
vcspull sync -c FILE                 → vcspull sync -f FILE
vcspull sync --workspace-root PATH   → vcspull sync -w PATH  # (or keep long form)
vcspull fmt -c FILE                  → vcspull fmt -f FILE
```

### Features

#### Developer Experience Improvements (#472)

- Action commands (`sync`, `add`, `discover`) support `--dry-run` for safe previewing of changes
- Structured output (`--json`, `--ndjson`) enables CI/CD integration and automation
- Semantic colors with `NO_COLOR` environment variable support
- Short `-w` flag for workspace root reduces typing
- Consistent flag naming across all commands
- `vcspull sync --dry-run` renders a Terraform-style plan (with live progress on
  TTYs) and exposes the same data via a stable JSON/NDJSON schema for automation

#### New Introspection Commands (#472)

- `vcspull list` - View all configured repositories
  - `--tree` mode groups by workspace root
  - `--json/--ndjson` for programmatic access
- `vcspull status` - Check repository health
  - Shows which repos exist, are clean/dirty, or missing
  - `--detailed` mode shows branch, ahead/behind tracking, and full paths

## vcspull v1.38.0 (2025-10-18)

### Improvements

#### Improved help output for `--help`

- Align CLI help output with CPython’s argparse theming by adding a dedicated
  formatter that colorizes example sections for top-level and subcommand help
  screens (#471).
- Expand `vcspull --help` to include additional example commands for the `sync`,
  `import`, and `fmt` subcommands, giving users clearer quick-start guidance (#471).
- Keep CLI logger discovery stable while refactoring the formatter into its own
  module, preventing additional loggers from surfacing in downstream tools (#471).

## vcspull v1.37.0 (2025-10-18)

### Breaking changes

- Rename the import CLI flag `--base-dir-key`/`--dir` and the related internal
  argument names to `--workspace-root`, aligning both user-facing options and
  implementation terminology with the workspace-root concept (#470).

### Bug fixes

- Normalize workspace roots during imports so equivalent labels (for example
  `~/foo`, `~/foo/`, `/home/user/foo`) collapse into a single canonical entry;
  avoids duplicate "already added" prompts (#470).
- Have `vcspull fmt` apply the same normalization before formatting and writing
  configs, so duplicate workspace-root sections are removed automatically (#470).

### Development

- Expand CLI tests to cover mixed workspace-root scenarios and the formatter’s
  normalization behavior (#470).

## vcspull v1.36.0 (2025-10-18)

### New features

#### New command: `vcspull import` (#465)

- **Manual import**: Register a single repository with `vcspull import <name> <url>`
  - Optional `--dir`/`--path` helpers for base-directory detection
- **Filesystem scan**: Discover and import existing repositories with `vcspull import --scan <dir>`
  - Recursively scan with `--recursive`/`-r`
  - Interactive confirmation prompt or `--yes` for unattended runs
  - Custom base directory with `--base-dir-key`

#### New command: `vcspull fmt` (#465)

- Normalize configuration files by expanding compact entries to `{repo: ...}`, sorting directories/repos, and standardizing keys; pair with `--write` to persist the formatted output.

### Improvements

- Enhanced logging system with better CLI module propagation and StreamHandler configuration for improved output visibility in tests and CLI usage (#465).

### Development

- Add Python 3.14 to test matrix, trove classifiers (#469)

## vcspull v1.35.0 (2025-09-04)

### Development

- libvcs 0.35.1 -> 0.36.0 (#467)

  Improved Git URL detection

## vcspull v1.34.1 (2025-06-21)

### Development

- libvcs 0.35.0 -> 0.35.1 (#466)

  Fixes issue with console streaming output, e.g. `git clone` progress.

## vcspull v1.34.0 (2025-02-22)

### Development

#### libvcs: 0.34.0 -> 0.35.0 (#461)

Internally, this libvcs will use `text=True` in subprocess, and deal only with
unicode. Before this change, handling bytestrings was supported.

#### chore: Implement PEP 563 deferred annotation resolution (#459)

- Add `from __future__ import annotations` to defer annotation resolution and reduce unnecessary runtime computations during type checking.
- Enable Ruff checks for PEP-compliant annotations:
  - [non-pep585-annotation (UP006)](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/non-pep585-annotation/)
  - [non-pep604-annotation (UP007)](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/non-pep604-annotation/)

For more details on PEP 563, see: https://peps.python.org/pep-0563/

  ```toml
  [tool.poetry.group.group-name.dependencies]

## vcspull v1.21.1 (2023-05-28)

_Maintenance only, no bug fixes, or new features_

### Development

### What's new

- Refreshed logo
- `vcspull sync`:

  - Empty command will now show help output

    ```console
    $ vcspull sync
    Usage: vcspull sync [OPTIONS] [REPO_TERMS]...

    Options:
    -c, --config PATH Specify config
    -x, --exit-on-error Exit immediately when encountering an error syncing
    multiple repos
    -h, --help Show this message and exit.
    ```

    To achieve the equivalent behavior of syncing all repos, pass `'*'`:

    ```console
    $ vcspull sync '*'
    ```

    Depending on how shell escaping works in your shell setup with [wild card / asterisk], you may not need to quote `*`.

    [wild card / asterisk]: https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/special-chars.html#:~:text=wild%20card%20%5Basterisk%5D.

  - Terms with no match in config will show a notice (#394)

    > No repo found in config(s) for "non_existent_repo"

  - Syncing will now skip to the next repos if an error is encountered

  - Learned `--exit-on-error` / `-x`

    Usage:

    ```console
    $ vcspull sync --exit-on-error grako django
    ```

    Print traceback for errored repos:

    ```console
    $ vcspull --log-level DEBUG sync --exit-on-error grako django
    ```

  - Syncing in git repositories with untracked files has been improved (via
    libvcs 0.17)
