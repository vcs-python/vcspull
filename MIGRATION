## Next release

_Notes on the upcoming release will be added here_

<!-- Maintainers, insert changes / features for the next release here -->

## vcspull 1.15.4 (unreleased)

### Completions for `-c` / `--config` files

_via #403_

After updating, you can re-run [shtab]'s setup (see [completions page]) completion of:

```console
$ vcspull sync -c [tab]
```

```console
$ vcspull sync --config [tab]
```

## vcspull 1.15.0 (2022-10-09)

### Completions have changed

_via #400_

Completions now use a different tool: [shtab]. See the [completions page] for more information.

If you were using earlier versions of vcspull (earlier than 1.15.0), you may need to uninstall the old completions, first.

[completions page]: https://vcspull.git-pull.com/cli/completion.html
[shtab]: https://docs.iterative.ai/shtab/

## vcspull v1.13.0 (2022-09-25)

### Pulling all repositories

_via #394_

Empty command will now show help output

```console
$ vcspull sync
Usage: vcspull sync [OPTIONS] [REPO_TERMS]...

Options:
-c, --config PATH Specify config
-x, --exit-on-error Exit immediately when encountering an error syncing
multiple repos
-h, --help Show this message and exit.
```

To achieve the equivalent behavior of syncing all repos, pass `'*'`:

```console
$ vcspull sync '*'
```

Depending on how shell escaping works in your shell setup with [wild card / asterisk], you may not need to quote `*`.

[wild card / asterisk]: https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/special-chars.html#:~:text=wild%20card%20%5Basterisk%5D.

### Terms with no match in config will show a notice

_via #394_

> No repo found in config(s) for "non_existent_repo"

- Syncing will now skip to the next repos if an error is encountered

- Learned `--exit-on-error` / `-x`

Usage:

```console
$ vcspull sync --exit-on-error grako django
```

Print traceback for errored repos:

```console
$ vcspull --log-level DEBUG sync --exit-on-error grako django
```
