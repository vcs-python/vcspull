# Worktree configuration example
#
# vcspull can manage git worktrees declaratively. Each repository can
# define a list of worktrees under the "worktrees" key. Worktrees
# are checked out in separate directories alongside the main clone.
#
# Each worktree entry requires:
#   dir:     Path for the worktree (relative to workspace root or absolute)
#   Exactly one of:
#     tag:    Tag to checkout (creates detached HEAD)
#     branch: Branch to checkout (updatable via pull)
#     commit: Commit SHA to checkout (creates detached HEAD)
#
# Optional fields:
#   lock:        Lock the worktree to prevent accidental removal
#   lock_reason: Reason for locking (implies lock: true)
